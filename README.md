Rubik cube project developed by Adler Antonio Calvillo and Jared Lopez.
The cube is represented by a tridimensional array 3x3x6, that is filled with numbers from 0 to 5, each face have instead of name of colors, a letter:
U (upper) is for white gace
F (front) is for green
R (right) is for red
L (left) is for orange
B (back) is for blue
D (down) is for yellow
There is 12 types of movemets, 2 per face, in the sense of clockwise and counter clockwise
The 'i' means that a movement is counter clockwise
Solving the cube is reached by 4 methods: Breadth-First-Search, Best-First-Search, A*, and A* Bidirectional.
